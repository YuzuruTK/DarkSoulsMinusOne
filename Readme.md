# Base Idea
- Survival Type Game BUT in RPG turn-based battle
- Using Print Weaver RPG System
- Like PokeRogue
- to do magic you need to order the words correctly, and always will be in other language than of the game
- it has to be an educational Game

# How it would work


- Game objective will be explore a Dungeon to kill the Arch-Lich
	- Dungeon will have 100 floors to reach Arch-Lich
	- It will have random floors and each Iteration will remake the Dungeon
		- it will be split in 4 sessions
		- each session will have a thematic
		- each 10 floors will have a boss fight
		- each floor has 3 battles and one equipment
		- each floor can have characteristics
			- 1 session can have from 0-2
			- 2 session can have from 1-3
			- 3 session can have from 2-4
			- 4 session can have from 3-5
		- level from enemies depends on the floor and session
- Game will have classes dependent on the type of your Fingers
	- Each class will have starter equipments
	- Each class will have base stats
- the player receive EXP for each kill made, and at max exp will level up
	- the max level is *infinite*
	- each level increases it maximum exp
	- each 10 levels grants one bless and one curse

## Core Mechanics from Print Weaver

- Status
	- There is 3 status
		- Strenght
		- Dextery
		- Willpower
	- You have 10 points in total
	- there are 3 types of Fingers, each one representing one Status, so you count how many you have as your status number
	- your initial life points are 1d10
	- your initial Defense is 3
- Dice Rolling
	- Dice rolling is very simple, there is an *Obstacle* that is a number of successful dices that you need to surpass
	- when you need to make a test from one stat you roll the N dices that you have in that stat
	- the success of the action will be decided by the quantity of success in each dice
	- a Successful dice roll is when you get from 6-10 in 1d10
	- Easy actions that has can need 3-10 of dificulty of each dice
	- Hard actions that has can need 8-10 of dificulty of each
	- Advantage and disadvantage varies the dificulty of each dice
	- EXAMPLE: you have to open a Big and Heavy Door, it has an Obstacle of 4, so if you have 5 on Strenght, you roll 5 dices, and need to have at least 4 of them with results of 6-10 
- Combat
	- The combat is made in turns, the actions order are defined by *Initiative*
	- *Initiative* is the number of success on a *Dextery* Test
	- Different Types of Weapons requires different Status
	- During your turn you have one action and move
	- In the battle targets can have different distances, like close, mid or distant, or how they call, Engaged - Close - Distant
	- There is Oportunity actions, like when the target is reading something or is casting a spell, they are concentrated and attacks to it are rolled in advantage
	- When you perform an attack, you first decide who and with what you will attack. Then it is rolled a dice check of the status the weapon uses plus the dice bonus of the weapon, the number of success that is above the *Obstacle* is the damage dealt
		- All damage dealt is physical, and it is dealt in *Strenght* status, when it reachs 0, it deals it on vitality
		- There is some types of damage that is dealt in *Dextery* or *Willpower* 
		- When *Vitality* reachs 0 you become unconsious, and if not help in the next turn you die
	- How Critical Hit works
		- If the attack Dice Poll has 10's equal or higher than the *Obstacle* it is a Critical hit
		- Every type of damage has an effect on Critical Hit, the bases like *Strength*, *Dextery* and *Willpower* just deal double damage but some others like Magical Types deal an different effect, like *Fire* Exausts the target
	- Parrying, if the dice poll success is equal to target *Obstacle* they parry you, you deal no damage and the target gains a turn, but if they fail the attack, they gain an *Prone* status
	- Mundane weapons can be brought to certain *NPC* to an *Ink-Imbuiment* in exchange for a High-Price
		- They exude an monstruous tincture
	- Skilled Actions, you can spend *Dextery* points to guarantee success dices, so you first spend these points and then you roll your attack, it is an *Special Attack*
	- Status Effects, as this world is painful, but is a little joyful sometimes, per short rest you recover from 1 status, except from Prone that is removed spending one move-turn
		- most of status conditions leads you to DEATH, the exceptions are *Blindness* and *Deafness*
- Survival
	- Each Day you can travel up to 4 Hexes, and then you need to sleep, if you dont then you'll gain *Exhausted* condition
	- To rest for the night, you need to make an *Warding Ritual* that makes you invisible to all monsters in the area
		- Each member on the rest camp, takes 10 drops of inc to ward
	- Resting, there are 3 types of rest
		- Short rest, for 1 day, you make checks for the 3 stats (Total amount of them) and recovers the amount of sucessful dices
		- Long rest, for 3 days,you recover the 3 stats on its maximum and 1d10 of Vitality
		- full rest, for 14 days, you recover everything to its maximum
	- Outposts, the player can make some permanent zones
		- takes 100 ink drops for each resident to uprade a camp to an outpost
		- it remains safe to rest until its defenses are up
	- Shrines, permanent ressurection areas
		- when 1000 of ink drops are spend on Outpost it evolves to Shrines
- Death and Revival
	- When you die you revive in the last Shrine, you have lost your body, items and everything that you had, except for the Rings
	- When you revive you have only one HP and all your stats are spent
	- Your dead body remains in the same place and after some time, some items will be stolen
	- The Printless, there is a chance when you die to a Printless rises from your body
		- when it spawns, the player that owns the dead body cannot spawn until it dies, and this is applied to all the players who dies for him
		- fun fact, a body reduced to ashes cannot become a printless :)
		- it tears apart all the equipments
		- it consumes the print marks from other players
		- it hunts the players always
		- you can be safe inside a safe heaven like a shrine
- Magic
	- Scrolls
		- it spend one point of *Willpower* to cast it, but you can increase it cost to roll more dices
		- if it has none opose it requires only one success, else it is described on the scroll how much you need
	- Books
		- it has inside two scrolls, so you save space, you can only change what scrolls are in your book in a rest
	- Tomes
		- it has inside five scrolls, so you save space, you can only change what scrolls are in your book in a rest
	- Ink-Imbued weapons are considered as magic weapons
	- **_ The Language of Magic _**, it is written in a series of connected lines and symbols called Minutiae. They share a striking resemblance to the lines and  forms that make up Print Marks, and when correctly positioned hold great magical potential. Minutiae also appears heavily tattooed into the skin of the Printless. he more Print Marks they consume, the more Minutiae appears across their flesh. If ever you see a Printless covered in inky minutiae, run.
- Loot
	- To create a system that gives a random loot based on the Print Weaver system, there is a table in the book to create it
